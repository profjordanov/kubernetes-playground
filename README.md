# Car Rental System

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/profjordanov/kubernetes-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/profjordanov/kubernetes-playground)

> Car dealers can publish their cars for rent. Each car ad must contain manufacturer, model, category, image, and price per day. Categories have a description and must be one of the following - economy, compact, estate, minivan, SUV, and cargo van. Additionally, each vehicle must list the following options: with or without climate control, number of seats, and transmission type. The system allows users to filter the cars by category, manufacturer, and price range anonymously. Ads can be sorted by manufacturer or by price.
When a user chooses a car, she needs to call the dealer on the provided phone and make the arrangement. The dealer then needs to edit the car ad as “currently unavailable” manually. The system must not show the unavailable cars.
